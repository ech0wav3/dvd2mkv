DGMPGDec Known Bugs and Limitations
-----------------------------------

"No-I-frame" streams cannot be processed.

Need auto horizontal scrollbar in file list dialog (no scrollbar when not needed).

DGParse should show the effects of FF decimation/replication.

Need to add back the autoincrement open option.

Not all DGIndex funtions are available through the CLI, and not all information that
DGIndex gathers can be accessed by a third-party application. For example, the DGIndex
Info dialog contents (and other info) should be readable via the CLI.

Decode to WAV is limited to 2GB WAV files.

DGDecode macroblocks on some severe video errors for which DGIndex recovers without
macroblocking.

DGMPGDec needs to be able to load older D2V files. Backward compatibility in general
should be a strong requirement.

DVR-MS files are not supported.

DGIndex should do audio playback.

DGIndex should process multiple audio streams from transport streams (just as it does
for program streams). Currently, only one audio PID can be specified at a time.

Unicode paths and file names are not supported.
