	0.8f:
	- added DVD2AVI-project file writing support... (cmdline -2).
		- i've tested this with progressive ntsc (princess mononoke r1), normal ntsc (gokudo-kun mannyuki r1),
		  fudgy ntsc (interlaced & progressive) (ah my goddess movie r1) and pal (5th element, r2 de).
		  in all cases output was identical to dvd2avi (after lots of bugfixing). phew.
		- i write hard-coded values for the iDCT (normal MMX), Field-Flags (none). these two can be
		  changed afterwards, as they do not change the data DVD2AVI needs to frameserve.
		- thanks to tron for the good idea ;)
	- changed t_vs_streaminfo (and some other structure) to include out_lba and out_flags
	- user-functions are now called separately for each output (but at least once)
	
	0.8e2:
	- improved IFO-parsing (now _should_ have correct audio & subtitle track display), after
	  reading one of Derrow's post at http://www.ultimateboard.de
	  i want to repeat that i don't trust IFOs further than i can spit ^_^
	
	0.8e:
	- when splitting output, even the 1st file gets a number (DVD2AVI friendly)
	- end-lba set from command-line using -w {LBA}
	
	0.8d:
	- added demacrovision (enabled by default)
	- removed r1-patriot specific program_stream_2 fix (i hope the general resync takes care of this)
	- improved PROGRAM_STREAM_2 parsing a bit (no more "last_system" funkyness)
	- added info to subp & audio info (in [] -> in which program chains they are active)
		- changed SDDS to DTS
	- added (ifo) video info
		
	0.8c:
	- implemented read-ahead for aspi, now it is as fast as windows/clib read
		(subtracting the time needed for seeks on the disc for parsing the udf-filesystem)
	- fixed incorrect output to stderr (aspect ratios)
	- fixed a (STUPID!) bug in the aspi-seek routines (used offset where i should have used origin)
		this should correct strange behaviour in aspi-files after key-search etc.
		
	0.8b:
	- improved 1gb handling (using flags) to use the extent_flags as size (bit 31)
	- corrected a few exports/statics definitions
	- udf-LBAs are now returned absolute (not relative to partition start)
	- fixed _BAD_ listmode bug when using ASPI (ups... got the boolean negation wrong!)
	
	0.8a:
	- fixed command-line parsing bug
	
	0.8:
	- fiddled a bit with language mapping (thx 2 qbert, tsunami, bruce)
	- now it _really_ should compile under linux (maybe not anymore, due to aspi/udf)
	- works on non 2048 byte streams , 'e' switch (only had 1 for testing) [big hack]
	- udf-parsing (using aspi), direct dvd access (t & u switches)
	
	0.7c:
	- added ifo audio & subpicture info (lang)
	- revived linux (cmdline) support (due to Arne Zellentin (arne@unix-ag.org))
	
	0.7b:
	- incorporated a few (interface) changes by Ingo Korb (ik@akana.de)
		- removed frame-rate descriptions and display them in 2 columns in the usage screen (to fit better)
		- -o and -i now accept an optional space (and -i warns if no param given)
	- renamed ofs_packets & num_packets to start_lba & end_lba
	- made it stop after (not on) end_lba, therefore now 0xffffffff means process all (and is default)
	- fixed ifo-parsing times (hex -> dec conversion)
	- tweaked DeCSS+ Keysearch settings
		
	0.7a:
	- fixed problem with multi-cell keysearch (would never really start looking)
	- fixed problem with empty/non existent list-file
	- improved ifo-multi-angle support (with tips from fu2k (thanks!))

	0.7:
	- fixed (many) use-the-same variable twice in the IFO-code (wasn't *that* clean after all),
		which lead to crashes and unpredictable behaviour (mixture of stupidity & cut/paste)
	- added support for up to 8 outputs at the same time (not useable from cmdline)
		(didn't want to cause too much hassle to DannyDin & doom9 which different cmdline-switches)
		
	0.6i:
	- enabled user_func even on do_output
	- sti.lba etc. always set
	- fixed a bug that closed a file twice on some occasions (splitting)
	- dll support
	- cleaned up ifo a lot (newer livid version, better encapsulation)
	- delphi GUI
		
	0.6h2:
	- fixed *stupid* rearrangement of code (display WRONG PTS-times)

	0.6h:
	- updated IFO-Parser a bit, added multi-angle support (seems to work on Disney R1 now)
		- added 'j' option to select angle (set to 0 to ignore angle flag), only works when IFO-Parsing
	- fixed a problem where IFO-Parsing might have resulted in skipping alternating VOB/CELL-IDs
	- rearranged loops a little

	0.6g:
	- changed compiler to VisualC (don't know whether it still compiles under linux)
	- changed file-io to _open (using _O_SEQUENTIAL hint under Visual C)
	- added string-list to file_io (list of input-files, terminated by \0\0), as opposed to string-file
		- moved stream-list parsing to main.c (vstrip only recognizes string-list ':' and single files now)
		- made '@' optional when ".LST" extension is used
	- added PTS-Info
	- added delay info w/ respect to VIDEO_STREAM_0 (0xe0) (based on DVD2AVI)
	- added errormessage on out-of-diskspace
	- fixed wrong lba printed when using -sX (seek)
	- fixed missing errormessage when no keys (at all) were found
	- improved DeCSS+ Method to be bit-based (as in DeCSS+2pre2), which is ~70% better than before
	- correctly (hopefully) redirected output to stdout/stderr (what about usage-infos?)

	0.6f:
	- added error message to empty file (also not authenticated)

	0.6e:
	- fixed bug in IFO-parsing (didn't alloc enought mem), was introduced in 0.6d, thanks to Johan N.

	0.6d:
	- changed into a one block/call method (vs_strip_one_block), the old interface is still available, though (internal)
	- fixed bug in resync-code (was not used w/ the old default value of 0)
	- added a default value of 2048 to main.c for number of resync bytes (instead of 0)
	- added check for "invalid" program streams: PROGRAM_STREAM_2 packets that either have
		invalid packet length or a missing padding stream (depends on how you look at it), so i skip that packet
		(fixed length of 1024 bytes assumed for PCI & DSI packets), thanks to robert m. for test-data.
		this should fix "Lost Sync [@ LBA 0]" errors that some people have reported (i thought they were due to the
		clib not being able to open files under certain circumstances).

	0.6c:
	- fixed incorrect CSS-detection
	- added key probability-counting based on repetative patterns (as in DeCSS+)
		- added 'm' option to set the value of a padding-stream derived key in comparison to a normal guess (=32)
		- added 'n' option to set the number of times a key needs to repeat (=32)
		- added 'q' option to set the percentage a candidate key has to have of all keys (=90)
	- added key refinding per vob-id

	0.6b:
	- added 'l' option to print cell-list (when ifo parsing)

	0.6a:
	- fixed stupid command-line parsing bug (e.g. vstrip in.vob out.vob (which is not valid anymore))

	0.6:
	- parsing vob-/cell-id as words now (not bytes anymore)
	- completely changed argument parsing (using - for options now)
		- renamed 'r' option to 'a'
		- added output file splitting support (-$N, where N is the size in megs)
		- output-file is an option now (-oOutName)
	- ifo-parsing (-i option for filename, -p for program-chain-selection)

	0.5e:
	- improved SPLIT option

	0.5d:
	- bugfix for accidentally deleting output-files

	0.5c:
	- added only keep GOPs option (producing small VOBs)

	0.5b:
	- fixed fio_close() bug if filelen == 0

	0.5a:
	- used VobDec lfsr-reversal code
	- changed filename-# to 2-digits

	0.5:
	- now under GPL v2
	- added support for writing raw PCM-Audio files (skipping 7 byte header)
		(see vs_KEEP_PCM_IDENT_BYTES), new default behaviour
	- when splitting by CELL/VOB-ID, any "we don't know where to put it" data
		is written to a out_PRE_outext file
	- the LBA for the CELL/VOB-IDs is now printed out
	- added lba-seeking (ofs_packets), see s-option
	- added num_packets in flags
	- decryption option when key is known
	- user_functions return bool value (cont. stripping)
	- fixed stupid "eof"-bug in list-mode (when exactly hitting the buffer boundary)
		(thx QWERT (the files didn't help, though ;))

	0.4b:
	- fixed too many open files-bug
