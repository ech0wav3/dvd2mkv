Change log

- 2.7.24 (20171205)
  Fix: MFlowBlur: possible access violation crash when nPel>1</li>
  New: MScaleVect parameter 'bits'. e.g. Analyze 8 bit clips, use their vectors for 16 bits
  Move project to VS2017

- 2.7.23 (20171012)
  Fix: MScaleVect wrong rounding of scaled motion vectors with negative components.
  e.g. proper scaling (-1;-2) to (-2;-4) instead of (-1,-3)

- 2.7.22 (20170830)
  Misc: Stop using version suffix .22
  Fix: [DCT 8x8@8bit] garbage on x64: internal assembly code did not save xmm6/xmm7
  Fix: [DCT 8x8@8bit] safe multithreading for integer DCT (8x8 block size, 8 bit video): assembly had a single working buffer.
  Fix: [MDegrain] did not release input motion vector clips in destructor, possible hang at script closing. Bug since 2.7.1.22 (introducing MDegrain4/5)       
  Mod: fftw conversion constant of sqrt(2)/2 is more accurate (was:0.707), 16 bit formats may benefit (by feisty2)
  Fix: SSE4 assembly instructions in x64, broke on non-SSE4 processors

- 2.7.21.22 (20170629)
  Fix: [MDegrainN] fix chroma plane processing

  Fix: [MMask] greyscale input resulted in AV when filter exiting

- 2.7.19.22 (20170525)
  New: [MMask] Support any planar input video formats e.g. greyscale, Planar RGB. 
               Input clip can even be of different bit depth or format from vector's original format
               For kind==5 where U and V is filled, the greyscale option is not allowed
  Mod: [MMask] Faster: request source frame only for kind=5.
  Fix: [MxxxxFPS,MMask]: MakeVectorOcclusionMaskTime garbage in bottom blocks (30 hrs of debugging)
  Fix: [MMask] bottom padding garbage for padded frame dimension
  Fix: [MMask] proper 10+ bits scene change values (for default: 1023, 4095, 16383, 65535. Was: 65535)
       Parameter is still in 8-bit range  
  Fix: [MRecalculate] prevent overflow during thSAD scaling in 16 bits or large block sizes (32, 48...)
  Fix: [DepanEstimate] Sometimes giving wrong motion instead of scene change detection
  Fix: [MAnalyze] Possible overflow in MAnalyze 8 bit, block size 48x48 and above.
       Overflow-safe predictor recalc for big block sizes
  New: [General] Add block size 12x3 for SAD, allow 6x24
       List of available block sizes

  Mod: [Internal] Reorganized 10-16 bit SAD simd intrinsics, faster 8-12% for BlkSize 12-32

- 2.7.18.22 (20170512)
  Fix: 10-16 bit: DCT buffer possible overflow

  Fix: DCT is fast again for non 8x8 blocksizes. Regression since 2.7.5.22.

  New: Chroma SAD is now always half of luma SAD, regardless of video format
       Without this: YV24's luma:chroma SAD ratio is 4:8 instead of 4:2 (of YV12)

  New: MAnalyze, MRecalculate new parameter: "scaleCSAD" integer, default 0
       Fine tune chroma SAD weight relative to luma SAD.
       ScaleCSAD values for luma:chroma SAD ratio
       -2: 4:0.5
       -1: 4:1
        0: 4:2 (default, same as the native ratio for YV12)
        1: 4:4
        2: 4:8

  New: Block sizes 64, 48, 24, 12, 6
       MAnalyze/MRecalculate new block sizes (SATD support mod4 sizes)
       List of available block sizes
         64x64, 64x48, 64x32, 64x16

         4x8, 4x4, 4x2
         3x6, 3x3
         2x4, 2x2

  Note: some smaller block sizes can only be available in 4:4:4 formats, due to block size division (chroma subsampling)

  New: All block sizes are supported in MDegrain1-6, MDegrainN, and MScaleVect

  New: Changed to 2017 version of asm files for 8 bit SAD/SATD functions from x265 project.
       Added not implemented asm code for 12, 24, 48 sizes
       For some block sizes AVX2 and SSE4 is supported (AVX2 if reported under AviSynth+)
       e.g. BlkSize 32 is faster now.

  New: MMask SAD Mask to give identical weights for other-than-YV12 formats, e.g. for YV24

- 2.7.17.22 (20170426)
  Fix: Regression in 2.7.16.22: MDegrain right pixel artifacts on non-modulo 16 widths
  Misc: MMask, mode SADMask output is normalized further by video subsampling (YV16/YV24 has larger SAD value due to bigger chroma part that classic YV12)

- 2.7.16.22 (20170423)
  Fix: MMask 10-16 bits
  Fix: MRecalculate 14-16 bits passed nSCD1=999999 internally which caused overflow (scene change problems later)
       Fix is done by clamping SCD1 to 8*8*(255-0) (maximum value of sum of SADs on a 8x8 block)
  Misc: MDegrainX 8 bits: internal 16 bit buffer to 8 bits: SSE2

- 2.7.15.22 (20170316)
  Fix: 16 bit SAD for non-AVX code path
  Misc: MDegrain1-6: add error on lsb_flag=true for non-8 bit sources
  
- 2.7.14.22 (20170206)
  Fix: MAnalyze divide=2 showed "vector clip is too small"
       (inherited from 2.6.0.5, sanity check was done but length was not filled for divideextra data)
  Fix: MFlow access violation in internal mv resizer when resizing factor was big (MCaWarpSharp3 4x supersampling case)
       (bug introduced in upstream 2.5.11.22)

- 2.7.13.22 (20170201)
  Fix: MDegrain1-6,N 10-16 bit thSCD scaling
  Fix: MVShow: tolerance scaling for 10-16 bits

- 2.7.12.22 (20170120)
  New: Faster SATD (dct=5..10) 8 bit: updated x264 function selectors, SSE2/4/AVX/AVX2
       +10% speed for a whole typical MDegrain3 process on my i7-3770
  New: Much Faster SATD (dct=5..10) 10-16 bit: SSE2/SSE4 instead of C 
       +50% speed for a whole typical MDegrain3 process (which is approx half speed of 8 bit)

- 2.7.11.22 (20170116)
  New: MDegrain6
  Mod: MDegrain1-6 SSE4 for 10-16 bit (was: C. 3-5% gain, wasn't bottleneck)

- 2.7.10.22 (20161228)
  Fix: for YV12 the debug info text chroma part was positioned at wrong place

- 2.7.9.22 (20161220)
  Apply 2.5.11.9-svp analysis speedup, mainly when chroma is involved

- 2.7.8.22 (20161218)
  Fix: YUY2 input access violation (regression after 2.7.0.22d)
       Fixed also in Depan.dll
  Fix: MDegrain: free up YUY2 planes only if not planar input (bug inherited from 2.5.11.22 MDegrain3)
       resulting in freeze at script exit

- 2.7.7.22 (20161214) - optimizing a bit
  speed: change some 8 bit SAD functions for the better
  speed: separating bottleneck 8 bit/16 bit code paths in order not to use slower 
         int64 calculations for 8 bit, where there are no integer overflow problems
  speed: more __forceinlines for helping the compiler
  info:  general speed gain of 5-15% compared to 2.7.6.22, much reduced speed gap
         compared to the "classic" YV12 8 bit mvtools2 versions

- 2.7.6.22 (20161204) - fixes and speedup
  fix: sumLumaChange underflow (used for dct=2,6,9) (regression during 16 bit support)
  fix: MeanLumaChange scale for 10-16 bits (used for dct=2,6,9)
  fix: Mask fix: 8 bit mask resizer bug in SIMD intrinsics  - Thx real.finder
       (regression on inline asm -> SIMD transition)       
  Fix: dctmode=1,2: pixel distance was not corrected for 16 bit pixel sizes
  speed: Let's help VS2015 with some __forceinline directives to recognize the truth.
  speed: Misc optimizations throughout the code (bit shifts instead of div or mul)
  speed: FFTW DCT: C code replaced with SIMD SSE2/SSE4 (FloatToBytes, BytesToFloat)
  speed: 16 bit SAD: a few optimizations in SSE2, AVX-coded SSE2 and AVX2 codepath
  VS2015 compiler: /MT -> /MD (from static to dynamic dlls - now it reallys need VS2015 redistributables)

- 2.7.5.22 (20161119)
  Milestone release:
  General support of 10-16 bit formats with Avisynth Plus (r2294 or newer recommended)
  with new MDegrain4 and MDegrain5 filters.

  Fix for MSCDetection: scene change filler pixel default value was always 0 (2.7.1.22 regression)
  MCompensate: possible bugfix bottom padding UV
  Fix SAD for 10-16 bit depths for horizontal block sizes >= 16
  Fix nSCD2 (Scene change threshold block count %) (2.7.1.22 regression)
  MBlockFPS: overlap fixes (right columns and bottom lines)
  MBlockFPS: overlap fix: missing copy buffer to output, thanks StainlessS

- 2.7.1.22 (20161020)
  Some additional fixes for YV24
  New: MDegrain4, MDegrain5
  Experimental native 10-16 bit support (MSuper, MAnalyze, MDegrain1-5, MDegrainN)
  including 16 bit SATD (slow C) and SSE2 optimized regular SAD for 8+
  (for 10+ bits you need at least Avisynth+ r2290), 
  Inline assembly rewritten to intrinsics -> 64 bit build is possible in VS2015
  (External assembly untouched)

  Note:
    Built with VS2015, this build is 3-8% slower than previous ICC build.
    Don't use it if you stuck at YV12 or YUY2 clips and this speed loss makes you unhappy
 
- 2.7.0.22d 
  Some additional fixes for YV24
  Allow greyscale input (Y8)
  dct modes >= 5 now use SATD again (so far it was in dead code, contrary to 2.5.13.1 remarks)
  fftw 3.3.5 support (changed function names, 3.3.4 still OK), see http://www.fftw.org/download.html
  XP support
  compiled to SSE2 with optional SSE4.2 paths
  (not new but don't forget: first search for libfftw3f-3.dll, then fftw3.dll)

- 2.7.0.22c: test build to support YV16 and YV24, 
  from now there is no need for YUY2 planar hack in scripts. Use ConvertToYV16() and work with it.

- Synchronized to Fizick's 2.5.11.22 version
  e.g. fixed: greenish garbage in MFlowInter
- Dropped tclip support in MFlow, MFlowInter (could not resolve with 2.5.11.22)
- 2.6.0.5 x64 capable version ported under Avisynth 2.6 API
- Fixed access violation in MDepan
- Fixed access violation in x64 asm code
- Built with Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition, v140 toolset
- Compiler: Intel C++ (because of inline 64 bit asm code)
